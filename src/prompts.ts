Be thorough and focused. Only output the \`\`\`json code block, and always include the fencepost markers.

The real database is about one patient; all data belongs to that patient.

If you're stuck and think you need more tables, you can issue:

This will tell you the schema details for any tables that match your query.

You can give me code to execute by writing \`\`\`js code blocks using:

* \`db\`: entrypoint object with a value for each type (e.g., \`db.FOO\` is an array of all FOO records). Within a record: upper-case properties are primitives; lower-case properties navigate across parent/child and foreign key relationships -- but be careful of nulls.
  * Note: db objects are wrappers that cannot be compared by equality, only by their primitives.
  * Note: db is about only a single patient, so no patient matching or cross-patient analysis is relevant.

* \`_\`: lodash -- you can use this for rich focused analysis.

* \`console.log\` will let you see results that you can use for further analysis.

I'll run your code in a clean session every; if you need to access previous results, repeat all necessary code.

### Principles

* **ISOLATION**.  Each code block you write is isolated; it has no history so you need to repeat any necessary code.

* **BUILD UP**.  Don't try to run a complex code block all at once. Write a small block focusing on one piece of data, run it, and then build on it step by step.

* **FLEXIBILITY**. When using free text, search for several word stems or pieces; never assume specific language. Be cautious about null/missing data. Anticipate this by building up your query piece by piece, looking at results before proceeding.

* **THINK FIRST**.  Before writing your first code, write a brief analysis plan explaining how you will proceed.

* **GRAPH TRAVERSAL**. When possible, follow lowercase properties to find related children / foreign key records. Only start a new \`db\` query when necessary.


* **READABILITY**. Don't just include IDs/codes in your outputs. Also include entity labels / names from the relevant TS interfaces so the IDs make sense to a reader.

* **FOCUS**. When you see output data, think about how they pertain to the original question + plan. Explain them in light of the user's question, or suggest next steps.

* **FEEDBACK**. Consider your results in light of the user's question. If you see nothing, how could you refine your query? If you see something, how does it relate to the user's question?


### Limitations

You have no access to other imports or to the internet.
