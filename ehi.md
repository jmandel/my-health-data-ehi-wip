# Unabridged Access to Your Electronic Health Information

Health standards focus on "Summary" and "Core" content. They provide a high-level and interoperable overview -- but they leave out details.

EHI is the unabridged book of your health.

## What is EHI?

EHI is the digital record of your health history, including everything from test results and diagnoses to prescription history and doctor's notes. It's a comprehensive, computable representation of your health record.

## Why is Accessing Your EHI Important?

When you have unabridged access to your EHI, you can:

1. **Own Your Health Narrative**: EHI provides a detailed, chronological record of your health, allowing you to have a complete, personal archive of your health journey.

2. **Be Prepared for Future Needs**: With a complete copy of your EHI, you have all the information you might need for future reference, whether it's for personal use, sharing with a new provider, or contributing to research.

3. **Contribute to Improving the System**: By requesting your EHI, you're testing the system and helping to identify areas where the process can be improved for all patients.

4. **Advocate for Your Rights**: Requesting your EHI is an important way to assert your right to your health data and advocate for policies that make access easier for all patients.

## How to Request Your EHI

Requesting your EHI is a right, but the process can sometimes be challenging. Here are the steps:

1. Contact your healthcare provider and submit a formal request for your EHI.
2. Be prepared to verify your identity to ensure the security of your data.
3. If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to follow up and advocate for your right to your data.

## Share Your Experience
