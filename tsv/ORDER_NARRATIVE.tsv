439060614	1	SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RNA NOT detected. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N

439060614	3	TEST DESCRIPTION: The SARS-CoV-2 (N gene detection) Test is a real-time RT-PCR assay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory swab specimens. Testing is limited to Exact Sciences Laboratories, certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. section 263a, to perform high complexity tests.	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N
439060614	4	Results are for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N
439060614	5	Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N
439060614	6	Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities. 	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N
439060614	7	Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. This assay is intended for use under the Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization.	65643	9/21/2020 12:00:00 AM	N
