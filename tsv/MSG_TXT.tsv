27931089	1	Hi Josh, 
27931089	2	
27931089	3	It seems like mychart is working fine, the messages are going back and forth. 
27931089	4	
27931089	5	jmandel@alum.mit.edu is the email address that we have on file. If you are having difficulty with mychart, you should call the help number for myunitypoint. 
27931089	6	
27931089	7	Would you still like to schedule a telehealth appointment or just continue to monitor for now?

27931089	17	I got a message here that my email address isn't working? jmandel@alum.mit.edu is my registered address and it should work, so it would be good to know if there is an issue here.
27931089	18	
27931089	19	Thank you for following up in app messaging here. Over the course of the last week my wrist has gotten much better; there was no injury that I am aware of but I had sharp pain when applying pressure under the thumb and pretty restricted range of motion for a couple of days. By now things are nearly back to normal, with just a bit of dull pain on pressure. At no point was there tingling redness or smelling.

7974993	3	I'm trying to send a message to my care team but I get the following errors:
7974993	4	
7974993	5	> Messaging is available to MyUnityPoint users after they have a scheduled appointment with a MyUnityPoint provider. After you have scheduled an appointment, your profile will be linked to the provider's care team and messaging will be available.
7974993	6	
7974993	7	I have already completed an appointment with Dr. Dhillon, so it looks like something may be misconfigured?
