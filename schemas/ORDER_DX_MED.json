Since one medication order may be associated with multiple diagnoses, each row in this table is one medication - diagnosis relation. We have also included patient and contact identification information for each record. Note that system settings may or may not require that medications be associated with diagnoses.  This table contains only information for those medications and diagnoses that have been explicitly associated.  Check with your clinical system Application Administrator to determine how your organization has this set up.",
