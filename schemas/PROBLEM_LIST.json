The data in this table reflects the current status of all problems on the patient's problem list. In the clinical system, each problem is marked as active until it becomes (and is marked) Resolved or Deleted. At that point, by default, it will not be displayed in the application. However, any problem ever entered on this list is stored in the database and will exist in this table. Deleted and resolved problems can be viewed in the application by simply marking a checkbox to show them. Note that deleted and resolved problems can be restored by undeleting them (an option in the application). When a deleted problem is restored, its status is changed to active and the deleted date is returned to null.",
