The extracted patient's roles (e.g., sperm donor, intended parent) on the infertility treatment cycle determines the data they are allowed to view about the other patients attached to the cycle. This view filters the full data of the INFERTILITY_CYCLE_LINKS table based on the extracted patient's roles to be safely exported without compromising PHI.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll extracted patients should be able to see the type of roles that were a part of a cycle (e.g., there is a sperm provider). Extracted patients with the role of intended parent should be able to see all the name of the known donors and the external donor information. Extracted patients with the role of known donor (a non-anonymous sperm or egg provider but not an intended parent) should be able to see all the names of the other known donors and intended parents but not the external donor information. Extracted patients with the role of anonymous donor should not be able to see any of the names of the other patients on the cycle or the external donor information.",
