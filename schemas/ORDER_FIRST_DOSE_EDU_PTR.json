To associate the point information with a patient, use the patient ID to join with the PAT_ID column in CL_PAT_EDU_NS, and then use the PED_ID column in CL_PAT_EDU_NS to join with the PED_ID column in one of the tables from above. To associate the point information with a patient encounter, use the patient CSN to join with the PAT_CSN column in CL_PAT_EDU_OS, and then use the PED_ID and CONTACT_DATE_REAL columns in CL_PAT_EDU_OS to join with the PED_ID and CONTACT_DATE_REAL columns in CL_PATEDU_CNTCT_PT or CL_PAT_EDU_LEARNER."
