  "description": "The HSP_CLM_EDIT_ERROR table contains information about your Hospital Billing claim edit errors. This table will have one row for each error that is on the claim print record (CLP) at the time of the extract. For each daily extract, the data will be appended on to the existing data in this table and this historical data will be preserved. So, if a claim had two errors and was in the claim error pool for three days, there will be six rows for that claim in this table (two rows for each of the three days that the claim had errors).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EXTRACT_DT column can be used to restrict your results to claim errors on a specific day. To see the errors in the claim error pool as of the last extract use EXTRACT_DT = today's date. This assumes the last extract for HSP_CLM_EDIT_ERROR was today.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical data for this table cannot be rebuilt, so full extracts should not be performed on this table.",
