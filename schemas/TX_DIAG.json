Since one transaction may be associated with multiple diagnoses, each row in this table represents one diagnosis and is identified by the transaction ID and line number. The first six diagnosis IDs associated with a transaction are recorded in the CLARITY_TDL table in the columns DX_ ONE_ID through DX_ SIX_ID. This table allows you to easily identify transactions with a specific diagnosis code or range of diagnosis codes. The data for this table is extracted using a KB_SQL query.",
